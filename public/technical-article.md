## Advanced Features Deep Dive

### Custom Events Management Workflow
```typescript
// Admin creates event
const createEvent = async (eventData: CustomEventData) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('custom_events')
    .insert([{
      ...eventData,
      station_ids: selectedStations,
      is_active: true
    }])
    .select()
    .single();
  
  if (error) throw error;
  return data;
};

// Real-time event filtering
const { data: customEvents } = useCustomEvents(artistName, stationId);
const { data: ticketmasterEvents } = useTicketmasterEvents(artistName);

// Unified event display
const allEvents = [
  ...customEvents.map(event => ({ ...event, isCustom: true })),
  ...ticketmasterEvents.map(event => ({ ...event, isCustom: false }))
].sort((a, b) => new Date(a.date) - new Date(b.date));
```

### Multi-Station Architecture
```typescript
// Station-aware data fetching
export const useSpinData = (stationId: string) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['spins', stationId],
    queryFn: () => fetchSpins(stationId),
    refetchInterval: stationId ? 5000 : false
  });
};

// Dynamic station configuration
const StationSelector = () => {
  const { data: stations } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['stations'],
    queryFn: fetchStations
  });
  
  return (
    <Select onValueChange={setSelectedStation}>
      {stations?.map(station => (
        <SelectItem key={station.id} value={station.id}>
          {station.name}
        </SelectItem>
      ))}
    </Select>
  );
};
```
