## The Challenge: Modern Radio Needs Modern Tools

Like many independent radio stations, we faced a common dilemma: our listeners expected modern, interactive web features, but our budget couldn't support traditional software development costs. We needed a professional playlist widget that could:

### Essential Features Required:
- Real-time playlist updates from Spinitron
- "Now Playing" detection
- Search and date filtering
- Mobile-responsive design
- Embeddable widget for partner sites
- Professional UI/UX

### Budget Constraints:
- No dedicated development team
- Limited technical expertise in-house
- Competing priorities for limited funds
- Need for rapid deployment
- Ongoing maintenance concerns
